// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Planning
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This includes gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas as prototypes."

const design = "Developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects such as its: UI, system interfaces, network, network requirements, and databases."

const implementation = "Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects."

const testingAndPlanning = "Helps reduce number of bugs and glitches users may encounter. This can lead to a better usage rate. In addition, testing helps identify for performance and if technologies are working seamlessly and correctly."

const maintain = "Occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys."
